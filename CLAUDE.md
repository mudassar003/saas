# Claude Agent Instructions for MX Merchant Invoice/Transaction Sync

## Objective
Ensure that all **transactions** from MX Merchant are captured ‚Äî including those **without invoices** ‚Äî and that any available **invoices** are correctly associated with their related transactions. Support **real-time sync** if possible using webhooks; otherwise, maintain accurate and timely data via cron-based or on-demand sync. Use Supabase for persistence and Next.js + TypeScript as the stack context.

---

## 1. Fetching All Transactions

### ‚úÖ Use the Payments API
Use the `GET /checkout/v3/payment` endpoint to fetch all **payment transactions**, including:
- Transactions tied to invoices
- QuickPay or POS payments that have no invoice

Each transaction object typically includes:
- `id`
- `amount`
- `date/time`
- `tenderType`
- `invoice` (may or may not be present)

**Also support:**
- `GET /checkout/v3/payment/{paymentId}` to fetch transaction details on demand.

### ‚ûï Store in Supabase
Insert or upsert each transaction into the `transactions` table. Schema should include:
- `payment_id`
- `amount`
- `created_at`
- `invoice_number` (nullable)
- `card_last4` (if available)
- `status`
- `merchant_id`

If the transaction includes an `invoice` field, try to associate it with an existing invoice.

## 2. Fetching All Invoices

### ‚úÖ Use the Invoice API
Use the `GET /checkout/v3/invoice` endpoint to fetch **all invoices**, regardless of payment status. This includes:
- Paid invoices
- Drafts
- Unpaid invoices

Also use:
- `GET /checkout/v3/invoice/{invoiceId}` for invoice details
- `GET /checkout/v3/invoicepayment?id={invoiceId}` to fetch payments associated with an invoice (e.g., partial payments)

### ‚ûï Store in Supabase
Insert each invoice into the `invoices` table. Schema should include:
- `invoice_id`
- `invoice_number`
- `status` (e.g., Paid, Unpaid, Draft)
- `merchant_id`
- `due_date`
- `line_items`
- `paid_amount`
- `balance`

---

## 3. Sync Strategy

### üïí Initial Sync
- Fetch all invoices and transactions for a merchant using `GET /invoice` and `GET /payment`.
- Upsert both into their respective tables in Supabase.

### üîÅ Incremental Sync
- Store `last_synced_at` timestamp per merchant.
- On each cron or on-demand run:
  - Fetch **new or updated invoices** since `last_synced_at`
  - Fetch **new transactions** since `last_synced_at`
  - Upsert them into Supabase

### üí° Real-Time Sync (Recommended)
Use MX Merchant Webhooks (Notifications API) for real-time sync.

#### Events to subscribe to:
- `Successful Payments`
- `Invoice Payment`
- `Refund Created`
- `Chargeback Created`

#### Webhook Setup:
- Use `PUT /checkout/v3/subscription` to subscribe a merchant to events
- Set `sendWebhook: true` and provide your app‚Äôs webhook URL
- Store webhook subscriptions in a `merchant_notifications` table if needed

#### Webhook Handling:
- For `Successful Payments`:
  - If `invoiceId` is present ‚Üí update invoice
  - If `invoiceId` is missing ‚Üí fetch transaction via `GET /payment/{id}` and store in `transactions`
- For `Refund Created` or `Chargeback Created`:
  - Update related invoice or transaction status accordingly

---

## 4. Data Linking

When syncing or receiving events:
- If a **payment record includes `invoice`**, attempt to **match it with an invoice in Supabase** via `invoice_number`
- If no match, store it as a **standalone transaction**
- On invoice detail fetch, also pull `invoicepayments` and link transactions to that invoice
- Update invoice `status` (e.g., Paid, Partially Paid) based on `paid_amount` and `balance`

---

## 5. UI Integration

In the dashboard:
- Display a unified list of **all transactions**
- For each transaction:
  - Show payment info: amount, date, card info
  - If linked to an invoice: show invoice number (hyperlinked to invoice detail)
  - If not: mark invoice as `N/A`
- Enable filters like: "All Transactions", "Only With Invoices", "Only Without Invoices"

---

## 6. Security & Reliability

### üîê Webhook Security
- Validate `x-mx-signature` header on all incoming webhook calls

### üß† Fallback Sync
- Even with webhooks, run a daily or hourly sync to reconcile missed data

---

## Summary of Endpoints Used

### Invoices
- `GET /checkout/v3/invoice`
- `GET /checkout/v3/invoice/{invoiceId}`
- `GET /checkout/v3/invoicepayment?id={invoiceId}`

### Transactions
- `GET /checkout/v3/payment`
- `GET /checkout/v3/payment/{paymentId}`

### Webhooks (if enabled)
- `PUT /checkout/v3/subscription`
- Events: `Successful Payments`, `Refund Created`, `Chargeback Created`

---

## Not in Scope
- Do **not** trigger or send invoices or receipts via MX API.
- Only fetch and associate data for tracking/reporting.

---

## Technologies
- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Job System**: Cron + webhook-based triggers
- **Client Auth**: MX Merchant API keys per merchant

---

## Completion Goal
At the end of execution, every MX transaction ‚Äî whether or not linked to an invoice ‚Äî should be captured in the app, with invoices attached where applicable, in near real-time or through fallback sync.
